%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%
\begin{dedication}
To everyone I've worked with over the past two years and to my family.
Each one of you is the epicenter of a unique perspective.
I have met no one I didn't cherish, and I am lucky to know you all.

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if
%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See

\begin{acknowledgements}
Thanks to Nishant Bhaskar, without whom this work would have never come to fruition.
Thanks to Kirill and Aaron, for their guidance, writing, good humor, and motivation of this research.
You helped me to learn more things in a few months than I learned in a lifetime before this project.

Thank you to the foundry, particularly Shelby Thomas, Vector Guo, Lixiang Ao, and Nishant Bhaskar,
for your support of my endeavors, encouragement, and advice.
Thank you as well to the rest of the Systems and Networking group at UCSD.
Being exposed to great minds is a blessing.
Thank you to Stewart Grant for looking over this thesis and psuedo-advising me on all matters.
There are times when everything is hopeless and your words pull me through.
We may have been passing by each-other on this journey, but I am thankful for \emph{even} that.

Thank you to Yvonne Li for the past four years.
Though our paths may now diverge, you were a counterbalance to both me and the life I led.
Thank you to my family.
To my father, whose strange perspective always colored my own in subtle ways.
To my mother, whose love and eccentricity remind me that science is not a machine.

Thanks also to the inspectors leveraging Bluetana in their unending hunt for skimmers.
You are the real heroes. Thank you for sharing your stories and being open to try 
the tech of a couple So-Cal punks.

Chapter 3, in part, is a reprint of the material as it appears in USENIX Security 2019.

%% ABSTRACT

%  Doctoral dissertation abstracts should not exceed 350 words.
%   The abstract may continue to a second page if necessary.

\begin{abstract}
Embedded devices installed inside gas pumps allow criminals to steal millions each year.
These devices, called skimmers, record unencrypted information transmitted by the pumps' payment circuitry.
Despite the monetary impact, no study of law enforcement skimmer recovery methodologies exists.
This thesis presents the first such study.
I discover that criminals often use Bluetooth to retrieve stolen card information.
I also find that current investigative mechanisms are ineffective.
These findings motivate the development of an Android application for skimmer detection, Bluetana.
Bluetana leverages Bluetooth and crowd-sourced data collection to detect skimmers.
This approach is effective: detecting 64 skimmers over two years.
