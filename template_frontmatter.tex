%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if
%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See
%  the OGS Formatting Manual for more information.
%
\begin{acknowledgements}
 Thanks to Nishant Bhaskar, without whom this work would have never
    come to fruition. Thanks to Kirill and Aaron, for their
    guidance, writing, good humor, and motivation of this research. 

 Thanks also to the inspectors leveraging Bluetana in their unending hunt for skimmers.
    You are the real heroes. Thank you for sharing your stories and being open to try 
    the tech of a couple So-Cal punks.
\end{acknowledgements}

%% ABSTRACT
%
%  Doctoral dissertation abstracts should not exceed 350 words.
%   The abstract may continue to a second page if necessary.
%
\begin{abstract}
  This thesis explores the detection of skimming devices installed in fuel station gas pumps. It begins
    with a survey of current techniques for skimmer detection as practiced by investigators in the 
    Arizona Weights and Measures Department. Following this, it describes the common features of
    internal fuel pump skimmers and the design of a mechanism for detection. This thesis concludes with
    the description of the implementation of such a mechanism, codenamed Bluetana, which was used
    to recover more than fifty skimmers in the 2018 and 2019 calendar years.  This thesis also includes 
    remarks on the design of crowdsourced applications and an analysis of the development pipeline 
    for a pseudo-sensor network of android cellphones.
