%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%

    To the end of the line.

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if
%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See
%  the OGS Formatting Manual for more information.
%
\begin{acknowledgements}
 Thanks to Nishant Bhaskar, without whom this work would have never
    come to fruition. Thanks to Kirill and Aaron, for their
    guidance, writing, good humor, and motivation of this research. 

 Thanks also to the inspectors leveraging Bluetana in their unending hunt for skimmers.
    You are the real heroes. Thank you for sharing your stories and being open to try 
    the tech of a couple So-Cal punks.

\begin{abstract}
Embedded devices installed inside gas pumps allow criminals to steal millions each year. These devices, known as skimmers, record unencrypted information transmitted by payment circuitry. Despite skimmers' impact, no study of law enforcement skimmer recovery methodologies exists. This thesis presents the first such study. We discover that criminals often use Bluetooth to retrieve stolen card information. We also find that current investigative mechanisms are ineffective. These findings motivated the development of an Android application, Bluetana, for skimmer detection. The core of Bluetana is a Bluetooth scanner that any commodity smartphone can run. Each Bluetana instance provides data to a back-end database for aggregation and analysis. This crowd-sourced approach is effective: detecting 64 skimmers over two years.
